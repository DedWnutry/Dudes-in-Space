## Code styling hint (for developers)  
**Check it periodically, cause there may appear some changes in the future.**
- usings ;
- namespace {
  - class name; 
  - private fields and properties;
  - public fields and properties;
  - private methods;
  - public methods;
  - public and private constructors;
}
(this styling may differ from the original C# code conventions)

## Branch naming rules 
**Whenever you start to work use these hints:**
- For enchancement (adding new feature) : task/#(issue number)-(task name)
- For bugfix : fix/#(issue number)-(bug name)

## Future ideas
**Will be soon.**
